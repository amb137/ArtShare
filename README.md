# ArtShare
Created By: Anna Marie Keppel Benson

Project Purpose

The app is designed as a tool to create an art portfolio and sharing work with other users. The goal of the project is for the application to be straightforward to use, clean, and functional. One of my great passions in addition to development is art, and through this project I integrate those two passions. ArtShare allows users to easily upload photos from their device onto their profile. Artwork is displayed in a grid format and can be magnified by clicking on individual pieces, which also displays additional information about the work including the title, materials used to create it, and a short description.

Future Features

Future versions of the project would include a newsfeed section for users to see otherâ€™s work and a pin feature to allow users to mark and save other artwork that inspires them. Additionally, a setting button to allow users to adjust their username, name, and password would be added.

To see a sample profile login with one of the following accounts:

**username:** annamkbenson 
**password:** anna

**username:** username 
**password:** password
